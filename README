A TAP output based unit testing framework that is in the spirit of
SRFI-64 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html).

The interface is similar and many procedures have the same names.
However, skip and expected fail functionality are included into
the tests themselves as keyword arguments instead of as separate
procedures/macros. Additionally, the test-name argument has been
moved to the end instead of being the first argument of each
test macro, so as to better work with Guile's optional and
keyword argument facilities. Another major difference is that
test-begin's cannot be nested, though test-group-begin does
add one level of nesting where all the tests within a group count
as a single test for TAP output purposes (first one to FAIL or
XPASS fails the whole group).

This module is not portable outside of Guile at this time. It
uses Guile specific exception handling code, uses
Guile specific optional and keyword argument handling lambda*,
and uses Guile specific module/library declaration.
