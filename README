A TAP output based unit testing framework that is in the spirit of
SRFI-64 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html).

A TAP output based unit testing framework that is in the spirit of
SRFI-64 (http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-64/srfi-64.html). The
interface is similar and many procedures have the same names.
However, skip and expected fail functionality are included into
the tests themselves as keyword arguments instead of as separate
procedures/macros. Additionally, the test-name argument has been
moved to the end instead of being the first argument of each
test macro, so as to better work with custom optional and
keyword argument facilities. Another major difference is that
test-begin's cannot be nested, though test-group-begin does
add one level of nesting where all the tests within a group count
as a single test for TAP output purposes (first one to FAIL or
XPASS fails the whole group).

This library is Guile, R6RS, and R7RS compatible. The main source file
src/unit-test-tap.scm is Guile specific (Common Lisp style docstrings
and Guile specific module/library declaration), but R6RS and R7RS
versions (src/r6rs/unit-test-tap.scm and src/r7rs/unit-test-tap.scm) are
built from it as part of building this package. The one catch is that
the R6RS and R7RS exception handling is used, which may not work with
all exception types in some implementations, especially if they were not
thrown with the R6RS or R7RS "raise" procedure.


INSTALL Instructions ===================================================

Generic instructions for configuring, compiling, and installing this
library are in the INSTALL file. Specific instructions are detailed
here.


The R6RS and R7RS-small versions have to be built from the Guile
specific version. After being built, they are found at
src/r6rs/unit-test-tap.scm and src/r7rs/unit-test-tap.scm.

The Guile version of the library is entirely contained in
src/unit-tap-test.scm. It is possible to just copy the file to where
ever it is needed; such as into Guile's site directory, which can be
found by running "(%site-dir)" at the REPL. On GNU/Linux, it will
usually be something like /usr/share/guile/site/X.Y where X.Y is the
effective version of Guile. Though, using the provided configure script
and make will allow this to be done in a more automated fashion as well
as compile to Guile's bytecode format (go files).

A configure script is provided that will produce a Makefile that can be
used to build the R6RS and R7RS-small versions of the library, compile
the library to Guile's bytecode format (go files), compile the library to
Vicare's object format (fasl files), install the library into Guile's site
directories for Scheme files and go files, install the library into
Vicare's library search path, build the documentation, and run unit
tests on the library in Guile, Chicken, and Vicare. The package is
configured using the configure script, which takes user input to tune
the build, finds and checks the desired Scheme implementations, and sets
options for the different Scheme implementations. Inside the package
directory, run

    ./configure [--prefix=DIR] [--with-guile=yes/no]] \
        [--enable-guile-compile=yes/no] [--with-guile-version=X.Y] \
        [--with-chicken=yes/no] [--with-vicare=yes/no]

where optional parameters can be used to set the base directory (prefix)
for installing the documentation, which Scheme implementations to target
(default is no for each one), and additional options for each Scheme
implementation. The supported target implementations are
guile (--with-guile), chicken (--with-chicken), and vicare
(--with-vicare).

For Guile, the scheme source files can optionally be compiled with the
--enable-guile-compile option (default is yes) and the Guile
effective version to target can be specified with the
--with-guile-version option (default is 2.2, followed by 2.0 if 2.2
cannot be found).

Now that the Makefile has been made, one runs

    make

to build the documentation in info format, compile the library to
Guile's bytecode depending on whether that was enabled or
not, and compile the library to Vicare's object format. The library can
be checked by running unit tests on it (using Guile, Chicken, and/or
Vicare) by running

    make check

Everything can be installed by running.

    make install

Installing the library itself is currently limited to just for Guile.

HTML documentation can be built using "make html" and installed by
"make install-html".

If you grab unit-test-tap from its source code repository,
configure will not be present yet. You need autoconf and automake in
order to generate them. They are generated by running the command
autoreconf.
